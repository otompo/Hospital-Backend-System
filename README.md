## 2. Technology Stack & Justification

| Component             | Technology Used               | Justification                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Framework** | Node.js (Express.js)          | Fast, scalable, and event-driven, making it ideal for real-time healthcare applications. |
| **Database**          | MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)        | Flexible schema for dynamic patient-doctor relationships and unstructured medical notes. |
| **Authentication**    | JWT (JSON Web Token) + bcrypt | Ensures secure stateless authentication, widely used in modern web applications.         |
| **Encryption**        | AES-256 (crypto module)       | Industry-standard encryption to protect sensitive medical notes.                         |
| **Scheduling**        | node-cron                     | Allows automated patient reminders and scheduling of medical tasks.                      |
| **LLM Processing**    | OpenAI GPT-4 API              | AI-powered analysis of doctor notes for automated task extraction.                       |

## 3. Authentication & Security

### **Design Choice: JWT (JSON Web Token) & bcrypt**

‚úÖ **Justification:**

- JWT allows stateless authentication, making it scalable and suitable for microservices.
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with security best practices.

‚úÖ **Implementation:**

- Users authenticate using email and password.
- A signed JWT token is issued upon successful login.
- The token is included in Authorization headers for API access.
- Tokens expire after a set duration (e.g., **5 days**) to reduce security risks.

---

## 4. Patient-Doctor Assignment

### **Design Choice: Dynamic Assignments Using MongoDB**

‚úÖ **Justification:**

- Doctors handle multiple patients, and patients can switch doctors if needed.
- MongoDB allows flexible storage and quick queries for patient-doctor relationships.

‚úÖ **Implementation:**

- `Assignment` Schema tracks active patient-doctor relationships.
- Patients can request a doctor assignment via API.

---

## 5. Secure Storage & Encryption for Medical Notes

### **Design Choice: AES-256 Encryption**

‚úÖ **Justification:**

- Ensures end-to-end encryption of sensitive medical data.
- Prevents unauthorized access, even if the database is compromised.

‚úÖ **Implementation:**

- AES-256 encryption is applied before storing doctor notes in MongoDB.
- Only authorized users (**doctor & patient**) can decrypt notes.
- Decryption happens on-demand, reducing security risks.

---

## 6. Dynamic Scheduling for Medical Tasks & Reminders

### **Design Choice: node-cron for Automated Task Reminders**

‚úÖ **Justification:**

- Ensures patients adhere to treatment schedules.
- Reduces administrative overhead by automating patient check-ins.
- Tasks reschedule automatically if a patient misses a check-in.

‚úÖ **Implementation:**

- A **cron job** runs every hour, checking for upcoming reminders.
- If a reminder is due, a **notification** is sent to the patient.
- If the patient fails to check in, the system extends the reminder schedule.

---

## 7. LLM Integration for Actionable Medical Insights

### **Design Choice: OpenAI GPT-4 / Google Gemini for AI-powered Processing**

‚úÖ **Justification:**

- Extracts key tasks and schedules from doctor notes.
- Reduces manual workload on doctors by automatically generating treatment plans.
- Enhances patient compliance by structuring tasks as checklists.

‚úÖ **Implementation:**

- The **doctor submits a note** via API.
- The **LLM processes the note** to extract:
  - **Checklist**: Immediate actions (e.g., _"Buy medication"_).
  - **Plan**: Scheduled actions (e.g., _"Take medicine daily for 7 days"_).
- Extracted insights are stored in the database and used to create reminders.

# API Endpoints

## **Authentication & User Management**

Endpoints for user signup, login, and authentication.

- **User Registration**

  - `POST /api/auth/register`
  - Registers a new user (patient or doctor).

- **User Login**
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
  - Authenticates a user and returns an access token.

---

## **Doctor-Patient Assignment**

Endpoints for assigning doctors to patients.

- **Assign Doctor to Patient**

  - `POST /api/assign`
  - Allows patients to select a doctor for medical consultation.

- **Get My Assigned Doctors**
  - `GET /api/my-assigned-doctors`
  - Retrieves a list of doctors assigned to a specific patient.

---

## Setting Up Access Token in Postman

### **Option 1: Using "Tests" or "Pre-request Script"**

1. Open **Postman**.
2. Click on your **Login request**.
3. Go to the **Tests** section (or **Pre-request Script** if "Tests" is unavailable).
4. Paste this script:
   ```javascript
   const response = pm.response.json();
   if (response.token && response.token.accessToken) {
     pm.environment.set("accessToken", response.token.accessToken);
   }
   ```
5. Send the login request.
6. Go to **‚öôÔ∏è Manage Environments** in Postman and verify `accessToken` is set.

### **Option 2: Manually Set Token in Environment Variables**

1. Run the **Login request**.
2. Copy the `accessToken` from the response.
3. Click **‚öôÔ∏è Manage Environments** (top-right).
4. Create a new variable:
   - **Variable Name:** `accessToken`
   - **Initial Value:** _(Paste your copied token)_
   - **Current Value:** _(Same as initial value)_
5. Click **Save**.

### **Option 3: Use Token Directly in Requests**

1. In **Authorization Tab** of your protected request:

   - Select **Bearer Token**.
   - In the **Token** field, type:
     ```
     {{accessToken}}
     ```

2. Or, in **Headers**, manually add:
   - **Key:** `Authorization`
   - **Value:** `Bearer {{accessToken}}`

Now, whenever you send requests, Postman will use the stored token dynamically! üöÄ
